                   <h3> How to read guitar strumming patterns</h3>
                Let’s talk about the basics of what you’ll see when you read the rhythm in a song. The first thing you should pay attention to is the time signature. The time signature is the two numbers you’ll see at the left side of the piece of music. You might run into 
                There are 4 beats per bar in most music in the western world. This is called 4/4 time. We simply have 4 evenly spaced out beats per bar. When you put the radio on, most of what you will hear will be in 4/4 time.

              <li class="list-group-item"> <center> <h4>Quarter note</h4><br>
                   <p>The four beats are represented by numbers as shown in the diagram below. These are called quarter notes and there are 4 per bar. Quarter notes occur in music on the downbeat, or where you would simply tap your foot.</p><br>

                    <img src="picture/down.png"><br>

                    quarter notes

                    If you are strumming your guitar and you played all quarter notes you would strum 4 down strums.</center></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><center><h4>Eighth Notes</h4><br>
              <p>The word `AND` in between is how you break down each beat into smaller sections. These are called eighth notes and there are 8 per bar. Eighth notes are twice as fast as quarter notes.

              You are simply filling in those spaces in between the numbers. There are still 4 beats in the measure BUT now we have added more music in the gaps.

              To count eighth notes we add he word “and” in between the numbers. Count four nice and evenly: 1, 2, 3, 4.

              Now add an “and” in between each number you count – keeping the counted numbers you spoke in the exact same “place”: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and…You are filling in the spaces don`t forget. You now have 8 counts. The 4 numbers, plus the four “and”s.

              <img src="picture/eight.png"><br>

              If you are strumming your guitar and you played all eighth notes you would strum 8 strums which would consist of 4 down and 4 up.</p></center></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><center><h4>Sixteenth notes</h4><br>
                  <p>To play sixteenth notes, you will play 16 notes per bar. These sound pretty fast.

                  To count sixteenth notes, you use the vowels `e` and `a`. Again these fill in the spaces, just like `and` does for eighth notes: <br>
                  <h5>1 e and a 2 e and a 4 e and a 4 e and a.</h5>

                  If you are strumming your guitar and you played all sixteenth notes you would strum 16 strums which would consist of 8 down and 8 up in a continous motion.</p>

                  s</center></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><center><h4>HOW TO PRACTICE</h4></center>
                  <p>One of the best exercises you can do to improve your rhythm guitar skills is to take a metronome, set it to a tempo of about 80 bpm, and play ONE NOTE repetitively while leaving the metronome running for as many bars as necessary with just quarter notes. Then do the same for just eighth notes, and then the same for just sixteenth notes.</p>

                 <p> Keep trying one note length until you are completely comfortable playing in perfect time with the metronome. This alone will dramatically improve your rhythm skills and give you a much better understanding of rhythm as a whole.</p>

                  <p>Once you are confident doing this, you can try one bar each of quarter, eighth and sixteenth notes, and then when comfortable just one beat of each.</p>

                  <p>It will be difficult at first and may take you a few days or weeks to be able to do this comfortably but stick with it. Practice it just for a few minutes each day and I guarantee you will be improving your rhythm skills dramatically.</p></li>

            <font >NOTE: Now pick a chords and practice four, six and eight chord.</font>

            <h4>Learn These few important tips before starting:</h4>
            <h5>TIP 1. SAY IT BEFORE YOU PLAY IT</h5>
             <li class="list-group-item">   Strumming patterns involves strumming down and strumming up. Sometimes, players get overly focused by when their hand needs to go down or up. You’ll learn the logic behind that in section 2. But don't forget: strumming a guitar is all creating a solid rhythm. You need to think like a drummer: your main job is to keep up that groove
              <br>
                So before you even touch your guitar, you need to hear the rhythm you want to play in your head first. You should be able to imagine in your mind what the strumming rhythm sounds like. A great way to check if you if you really ‘know’ the rhythm is to sing, hum, beatbox, tap or say it out loud. In other words: say it before you play it. ‘Cause if you can’t do that, playing a solid strumming groove on guitar will be impossible.</li><br>
                <h4>2. KEEP A LOOSE WRIST</h4>
             <li class="list-group-item">So how do you strum a guitar correctly? Firstly, make sure you're not locking your wrist: you need to keep it nice and loose. Most of the movement will come from rotating your lower arm (you could also say: twisting your wrist) and letting your hand and wrist hang loose and follow that motion. (Funk guitarist Ross Bolton calls this a ‘drunken wrist’. I like that.) You might be tempted to make the up and down movement with your lower part of your arm (your forearm), but though your lower arm will be moving up and down a little bit as well, but that’s only a small part of the movement.</li><br>
             <h4>3. NEVER STOP MOVING YOUR STRUMMING HAND</h4>
             <li class="list-group-item"> You need to keep your strumming hand moving at all times, even when you’re not hitting any strings for a couple of beats. By doing this, you’ll no longer have to consciously think about when you need to move your strumming hand: it’s moving all the time. The constant motion also makes it much easier to keep time. We’ll take a closer look at how this works in section 2.</li><br>
             <h4>4. DON’T HIT ALL THE STRINGS WITH EVERY STRUM</h4>
             <li class="list-group-item">You might think you need to hit all the notes in the chord with every strum, but usually we hit just three or four strings. So how do you know which strings to aim for? That depends. Remember that your main job is to keep up the groove. To do that you want to emphasize certain parts of the beat. A very rough rule of thumb is that you’ll want to hit lower strings on the first and third beat, and high strings on the second and fourth beat.</li><br>
